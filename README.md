# Alexandre thinks #100DaysOfCode is a really good idea...

...**and this is the result of day 0!** Welcome to this very simple (b)log of the experiment.

## What is the #100DaysOfCode initiative?

There are two main rules according to the [official website](https://100daysofcode.com):
> 1. Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
> 2. Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.

I guess I will mostly stick with the first one; although I have a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/protsaq), nobody deserves to be spammed by my small increments in coding ability ðŸ¤«

## Why a website? 

swyx's [**The Coding Career Handbook**](https://www.learninpublic.org/) is very persuasive in communicating the *power of writing*. On the other hand, I am in need of a regular log to set down my goals and motivations for the hypothetical career in coding. So, instead of [building a whole website from the bottom up](https://bzzzzzzz.buzz) (which is not a great idea if you want to get productive ASAP), I searched on [JamStack](https://jamstack.org/) for an appealing stack. [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) seems ideal - I want to learn both JavaScript and Vue in the very near future.
