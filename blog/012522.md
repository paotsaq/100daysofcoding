# {{ $page.title }}

This is a very exciting time for me. As if I were experiencing the launch of, say, the 1.0 version *of something* — the sort of thing so magical you might tend to tie it up with astrology or something. I always hear it is Mercury retrogade to blame, but I'm not even sure I got that word right.

The website is up and running, and the music is like a huge party is getting on! 🎉 And then, everyone left, and you can hear a piano powerfully reverberate throughout a wide room. Most of it, as of now, is chance: I have a set selection of songs that are randomized with some crossover, and tried doing many genres at once. You can tell I'm very excited! 🎊

There's something I heard, from someone I hold very highly, that has stuck with me ever since — something among the lines of *never celebrate your highs too much*. It was better put, of course, and said in a manner such that cared for one's motivation, and some sense of structure; maybe happiness? Since then, I like to believe myself to better handle these situations — hopefully, not too taken away with the excitement, and forget how much effort, *and time*, it takes to accomplish something nice.

## That is done! What's so big, then? 🧐

The website running a radio stream 24/7, that is what! It ~~absolutely is~~ seems to be, so far, 100% functional. But there are so many improvements to be had, which such a great many paths to take!

### be able to export playlists 🪵
At the moment, a `mpd` client is running an easily editable playlist, but maybe it could be nice to have a running history of it. Not only that, but playlist-fu in general seems like an obviously necessary skill in this situation;
### audio is too loud 🤯
This is bad. And it also reveals a glaring accessibility problem. In fact, I'll stop the stream right now, as this might hinder the user experience so much it does more harm than good. Which leads to the next one...
### communication with the server must be **efficient** ☑️
It takes a long while to get to shutting off the server. It must be as fast as putting a fire out 🧯
### get some metrics! 📊
I mean...I'm allowed, right? This is the internet after all 👺 Just knowing peak times should be interesting, and maybe trying to influence retention by UI/UX. Am I becoming evil? In any case, I won't go any further than what is so lightly given away these days.

::: tip Some `ncmpcpp` commands

- `v` reverses the selection (if none are selected, selects all);
- `shift + v` clears selection;
- `shift + arrow` selects in the direction of the arrow (up or down);
- `m` and `n` moves a selection up or down;

## Fixing the playlist export 🎻

This might not seem like a priority - in fact, audio volume control is much more important - but I can just play quieter music until that gets implemented. Plus, I really want to setup a history of the broadcasts.

Exporting the current playlist is failing due to a lack of permissions on `mpd`. This is a silly problem, but I need to refresh my memory on users, groups and permissions anyway. It is currently running as a service. Running `id mpd`, I get

`uid=110(mpd) gid=29(audio) groups=29(audio)`

by changing the folder ownership to `audio` and permissions for group `rwx`, it is able to create the playlists (although I find it a little weird that it needs execute permission to create files 🤔). So, that is done!

```
pi@raspberrypi ~/music ➤ sudo ls -l playlists                                                                                                                             git:master*
total 12
-rw-r--r-- 1 mpd audio 4485 Jan 25 11:48 012422_first_playlist.m3u
-rw-r--r-- 1 pi  pi       0 Jan 25 11:41 lala
-rw-r--r-- 1 pi  pi       0 Jan 25 11:47 sdijf
-rw-r--r-- 1 mpd audio 1960 Jan 25 11:58 test.m3u
```

The playlists are created under the `mpd` user in the `audio` group; my default `pi` user doesn't have access to it by default, but `pi` is a member of the `audio` group. However, again I need execution permissions. I'm not really sure what is going on, but *it is working*, and I'll leave it as such for now.
