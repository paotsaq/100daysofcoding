It is shameful that there was no further Haskell work since the last time it was mentioned in here; to properly learn something one must be regularly at it. [I found a nice website with lots of Haskell practice problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems), and here are my takes on some of these.

### 1.1: Get the last element of a list 

```haskell
myLast :: [a] -> a
myLast [] = error "Oops! List is empty!"
myLast [a] = a
myLast (_:xs) = myLast xs
```

Most of these could be solved more syntactically with the help of `Prelude`, a module containing standard functions (akin to what `len` would be in Python, for example). 

```haskell
myLast :: [a] -> a
myLast [] = error "Oops! List is empty!"
myLast x = last x
```

This would also work!

### 1.2: Get the second to last element of a list 

A little quirkier. Following the same line of thought from the previous exercise would lead to this:

```haskell
secondToLast :: [a] -> a
secondToLast [] = error "Empty list!"
secondToLast (a:[]) = error "Just one element!"
secondToLast (a:b:[]) = a
secondToLast (_:xs) = secondToLast xs
```

But notice how cumbersome this would be for every further step away from the end of the list; there are two cases accounting for input errors. Luckily, the website presents some solutions to problems. Here's a very nifty one, with cool notation.

```haskell
myButLast :: [a] -> a
myButLast = last . init
```

The `.` stands for composition of functions; `init` takes all but the last element of the list; `last` takes the last one of that. Makes sense, and since it relies on builtin functions, these already account for the empty list and one element list exceptions.

### 1.3: Get the k'th element of a list (starting at index 1)

Again, this is quite similar to the `!!` function, so I took advantage of that. 

```haskell
elementAt :: [a] -> Int -> a
elementAt (xs) k = 
    if length xs < k then error "Too few elements!"
    else xs !! (k - 1)
```

So that is a `if/else` structure; but then one could just use *guards*.

```haskell
elementAt :: [a] -> Int -> a
elementAt (xs) k = 
    | length xs < k = error "Too few elements!"
    | otherwise     = xs !! (k - 1)
```

Very similar structure, but a little more Haskell idiomatic!
