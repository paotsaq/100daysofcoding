**The task:** display current song information on the website;
**The process:** connect to the `mpd` instance of the Raspnberry;
**The trouble:** oh, so many.

## What I tried so far...

Many things. Dockerisation of the `mpd` instance is a mess (handling configs, volumes, etc.), and will come later; after many experiments, it's just not worth it for now. I'll keep it running on the bare Raspberry, and figure something out.

Having made peace with that solution, I mused having the API run on the bare Raspberry, without being containerised —  but it needs Certbot approval (otherwise the certified website would incur in a mixed content issue), and the certification is being handled with the dockerised nginx. Could it be made so that [nginx routes to the main machine, outside of the containers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31324981/how-to-access-host-port-from-docker-container/61424570#61424570)? 

Well...apparently, [this works!](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48547074). nginx is pointing to `172.17.0.1` on the API's port, and it is now serving the current song information over HTTPS, avoiding mixed content. Programming is such a weird endeavour!
