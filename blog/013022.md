# {{ $page.title }}

With the `mpd` instance up and running, and the song API deployed, one would think there is little left to be done. Oh, how wrong would that assessment be! As I said before, this Raspberry is running a torrenting service ‚Äî Transmission ‚Äî with a few perks: it has a watch folder, and it downloads to a particular directory. Unfortunately, this is a long running machine, and some setup errors led to sometimes having two or three different instances of the service. 

I need to sort this out, as the stack relies heavily on getting files from this service.

## How to trace the OS behaviour üßê

After a reboot, I can see the Transmission client is already running. With a `ps aux` command, one can see the running processes on the machine; add a `grep` to it, and it filters for Transmission instances.

```
debian-+   652  2.6  3.5 109104 33176 ?        Ssl  11:04   1:04 /usr/bin/transmission-daemon -f --log-error
```

I learned that the `+` stands for an incomplete name; in fact, `debian-+` is actually `debian-transmission`. 

Now, the issue is figuring out where this service loads its configuration file from. I'm wondering because there are *lots of files* ‚Äî my files, mind you ‚Äî still seeding, but the daemon behaviour seems off. It doesn't care for the watch folder anymore, for example. [A user on a forum suggests](https://forum.transmissionbt.com/viewtopic.php?p=73008&sid=386a0066c4886d6c5d748895fe6ab9ec#p73008) "`Run the daemon with -f and --logfile <path> and --log-debug and the logfile should tell you which settings.json file it is loading`". I used `/tmp/transmissionlog` as a path (to avoid permission issues), and restarted the service. This is the output:

```
[2022-01-30 12:27:18.515] Using settings from "/var/lib/transmission-daemon/.config/transmission-daemon" (daemon.c:528)
[2022-01-30 12:27:18.515] Saved "/var/lib/transmission-daemon/.config/transmission-daemon/settings.json" (variant.c:1274)
```

[This is a very useful blog post](https://zsitko.com/transmission-raspberry-pi/) that outlines answers to many of my questions, and in fact the Transmission service is loading the expected config file. This doesn't still answer my question ‚Äî why did it lost sight of the watch folder? ‚Äî but I suppose I won't ever get an answer to that question.

I configured it to have a proper watch folder, and everything seems to be working correctly (it survives a reboot with the proper config!).
 
## What now...? üåÖ
The next step is a clean-up of the downloads directory; I'd like to start all over again and build the 24/7 radio stream upon a new database. There's a catch, however: I don't want to delete any torrents that rely upon me as the only seeder. Although the client stopped seeding these ‚Äî it has fully transitioned into the new user - the tracker I use has an API. I can run through every torrent file, check it against the API, and determine whether or not I should keep it. This is a very standard scripting procedure and I don't expect it to take too long.
