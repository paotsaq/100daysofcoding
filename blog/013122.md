My whole morning was ~~wasted~~ spent on a bus drive back to Lisbon. It's really not a good place for work, but trains in Portugal are crazy expensive on short-notice trips. Not that this particular one was short-noticed; it also happens that I am quite disorganised. I plan on getting a smaller computer (12.5") in the near future, so that commuting - and maybe sun-bathing at a park - is a little more inviting to work.

## Getting some QoL improvements on the website!

Having set up the two sources of streaming, some adjustments can be made to the website. The play button can now be unique, with its `src` element (the source of the stream) set accordingly to a simple priority case: if the live stream (ie. a live radio show) is up, have its url on the `src` property of the stream, and place the 24/7 Raspberry broadcast otherwise. It seems to work quite nicely and the code took only some minor adjustments to work.

I didn't do much, today.
