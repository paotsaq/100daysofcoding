To help me get back on track more quickly, I went for a swim today, before work üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and it felt quite good. Swimming is a very complete form of exercise; it pumps my heart-rate to very high levels, maybe even more so than my cycling. 

## Getting back at Vue ü§π‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

It has been a while since I touched this particular project. It's not like there was no progress at all - since I was improving my Javascript chops on the side, I feel much more confident on the front-end chops. But the application needs some advancing, and today the focus shall be on *modals*.

Modals are [*a graphical control element subordinate to an application's main window*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window) - something like a prompt overlay with diaogue, expecting some user action. DigitalOcean is, as always, [a great resource on anything techie](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/vuejs-vue-modal-component). I followed this - and shamelessly lifted their great CSS -, and the modal overlay is now working quite well. There's really not much science to it.

The later steps of this project are quite scary: it must connect to a webcam and save a picture from it, for example. I'm still not sure how to handle *that*, but that's a problem for future Alexandre to solve, anyway.
