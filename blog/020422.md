# {{ $page.title }}

I've been eyeing a new machine for quite a while now. My main computer is rather large and heavy - a 16" -, and it's not too practical for commutes nor for outdor work. On the hunt for something a little smaller and resilient enough to be carried around with no worries, the Thinkpad models crossed my mind. At first I looked into the x250 model, but the x260 had the native HDMI port (instead of the very outdated VGA) which struck my fancy. After a couple of weeks of intensive searching throughout the internet, I found a FullHD equipped model, and with the i7 processor to wrap up the beauty package.

So...I'm very excited about working with a Linux distro (Manjaro with i3 for now) and tailoring it to my taste. And I'm also keen on understanding where a different work platform might have a positive impact on my daily life (Manjaro is, by its very nature, much less distracting than my daily driver Mac OS - at least for now!).

## Trouble so far...

I can make a pretty hefty list of issues that need some special care. 

### There are no emojis! :(

You probably noticed by now how barebones this post looks! It's so sad not to have emojis.

### The keyboard is swedish, or something?

This is fine, as I am already used to having the US keyboard as input; the company whom I bought the machine from actually sent a complimentary sticker pack for the keyboard (naturally, the first thing I did was omit the Windows logo, which now has a sideways X over it), but it features the Portuguese keyboard, which I am not a fan of either.

### Still some accessibility issues!

I have decent eyesight, but struggle a lot with small font. This display is rather small with a high definition, thus font is naturally small by default. The 
default terminal had no obvious way of increasing the font size, thus I went for the Kitty terminal, that reacted positively to the `ctrl +` combination. But there are still many other configs to do (it's been killing me to have Caps Lock with its original function - I usually set it to `ctrl` now).

## I'm very excited!!

Yes! This is good. It took me just a couple of minutes to set up my ssh keys, and in no time got access to my usual workflow. And that feels really cool!
