# {{ $page.title }}

What mostly excites me about working on this particular machine (the school's iMac) is both the great size (this is a massive 27" screen!) *and the ability to PLACE üëè SOME üëè EMOJIS!* I'm still trying to take care of that.

## Further work in Vue!

I'm not sure I've been throught this before, but I'm developing an application that front-ends an API for entry logs in the school. A friend of mine has built the back-end in Go, and today the goal is to get some API calls going.

To start with, I created a simple button, with a `@click` directive. It calls a `getLogs` function which, for now, will only log `success` on the console (baby steps!)

``` html
<button @click="getLogs">Get Logs</button>
```

The next step is bringing some Axios connectivity. Sequoya, the friendly mindful tree, taught me about centralising Axios on something akin to a module, instead of redefining it across all components. This is quite sound advice, so I'll follow on his footsteps. Below is how I defined my Axios module, with two interceptors that log both the request and its response.

``` js
const axios = require('axios');

const ax = axios.create({
	baseURL: 'http://localhost:8080',
})

ax.interceptors.response.use((res) => { 
    console.log(res);
    // Important: response interceptors **must** return the response.
    return res;
  }),

ax.interceptors.request.use((req) => {
      console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
      // Important: request interceptors **must** return the request.
      return req;
    });

module.exports = ax;
```

Having generalised the Axios calls, now I need to refactor the working Axios GET request that was already implemented. After a few brief tweaks, the following code works.

``` vue
<script>
import ax from '../../utils/axios.js';

export default {
	data: () => ({
		connectivity: false,
	}),
	mounted () {
		ax.interceptors.response.use(res => {
			console.log(res.data);
			if (res.data.message == 'pong')
				this.connectivity = true;
			return res;
		});
		axios.get('http://localhost:8080/ping')
	}
}
</script>
```

There's a small hurdle with this particular refactor, that is, I feel, mostly due to my lack of familiarity with Javascript. I can change the previous structure to this, and it will work.

``` js
mounted () {
	ax.interceptors.response.use(res => {
		if (res.data.message == 'pong')
			this.connectivity = true;
		return res;
	});
	ax.get('ping')
}
```

but I do wonder, however, if it would be good practice to set up two interceptors (remember one is already set up on the `axios.js` file!). I feel this could also be achieved with the following

``` js
mounted () {
	ax.get('ping').then(
		function (res) {
			if (res.data.message == 'pong')
				this.connectivity = true;
	})
}
```

but this yields an error of `Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: this is undefined`. I did some searching, and came across [a very useful post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36176073/what-is-vue-way-to-access-to-data-from-methods) that seems to tackle this issue head on! Using their trick of defining a variable inside the `mounted()` scope that references `this`, it is now possible to go with 

``` vue
<script>
import ax from '../utils/axios.js';

export default {
	data: () => ({
		connectivity: false,
	}),
	mounted () {
		ax.get('ping').then(
			function (res) {
				if (res.data.message == 'pong')
					this.connectivity = true;
		})
	}
}
</script>
```

which feels much cleaner!
