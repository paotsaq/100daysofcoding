## A coding marathon! ‚å®Ô∏è

I really enjoy the idea of a coding marathon! It brings back memories of teenager Alexandre, his exciting, franctic dialogues with a keyboard all night long - a shame it was mostly with stupid games that didn't do much for adult me now, but, still: *nostalgia*! ‚ú® So the school arranged for 42 straight hours of coding, of which I skipped the first fifteen or so - Cinemateca was screening a Gene Kelly double bill, with *Singin' In The Rain* and *It's Always Fair Weather*, and I wouldn't miss that for *anything* - but I do now feel both the contact high of *lot's of enthusiasm to code* and an arresting need to include singing and dancing into *every single activity*. What a disastrous mix! üí•

Of course, time calls for some focus on the 42 course; but there are *so many other exciting things* to partake on!

## Syncronization across all my devices!

This is a recurring problem, ever so worse as new devices and workspaces are added to my life. As a `vim` enthusiast, my workflow is highly dependant on very specific configurations I've tailored to my needs; but it's not unified across the at least four regular workstations I have access to. So I suppose that changes...*right now*!

I've been giving this some thought the past couple of days, and `rsync` seems like the best solution: the Raspberry acts like the central entity which holds the latest configuration, and every device shall, upon waking, syncronize its settings with it. Seems easy?

[The tool documentation](https://rsync.samba.org/documentation.html) is great! There's a discussion on needing to run `rsync` as a daemon on the background for handling of repeated or frequent calls; I'm unsure that is necessarily my case. For now, all I need is a nice script to run whenever I need changes to be pulled and pushed.
