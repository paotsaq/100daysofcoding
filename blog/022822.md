# {{ $page.title }}

I want to get back at working on my Vue project, but couldn't face myself to tackle it without proper tools for autocompletion, and a linter, and etc. Now, there are _a lot of moving parts_ with this sort of configuration, so let's delve into that. (I loosely followed [this resource!](https://morioh.com/p/e472c4057aeb))

## First steps first! 🐾

For a good autocompletion service, one can get [CoC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) (really, a rather unfortunate name 😳). I installed a couple of extensions for languages I shall use frequently — Python, Web Development (html and css), and Vue). These go into `.config/coc/extensions/package.json`.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "coc-css": ">=1.3.0",
    "coc-eslint": ">=1.5.7",
    "coc-html": ">=1.6.1",
    "coc-json": ">=1.4.1",
    "coc-prettier": ">=9.2.3",
    "coc-pyright": ">=1.1.223",
    "coc-tsserver": ">=1.9.13",
    "coc-vetur": ">=1.2.5"
  }
}
```

## Some more plugins 📦

For a linter, I got [CoC's eslint](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-eslint)

As soon as one gets CoC installed, there's suddenly lots of information and many moving parts for someone that is used to Vim's simplicity. It really feels like information overload.

Just by reading Coc's GitHub page, I came across a quick fix for all of the text shifting whenever there was a Javascript code issue that eslint caught:

```
`" Always show the signcolumn, otherwise it would shift the text each time
" diagnostics appear/become resolved.

" Always show the signcolumn, otherwise it would shift the text each time
" diagnostics appear/become resolved.
if has("nvim-0.5.0") || has("patch-8.1.1564")
  " Recently vim can merge signcolumn and number column into one
  set signcolumn=number
else
  set signcolumn=yes
endif
```

It seems like `eslint` acts on the syntax of the code (bad tag closure, repeated function names, missing commas) which is really very useful (Alexandre is a very clumsy programmer), while `prettier` enforces a very specific ([although, it seems, increasingly global](https://prettier.io/docs/en/why-prettier.html#ride-the-hype-train)) code formatting standard. And I love it! It always feels like I'm doing Javascript *wrong*, andthis is a nudge in the right direction of making Vue easier to code in.
