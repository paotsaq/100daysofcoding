Even though I didn't have a great night of sleep, somehow I managed to go have a swim in the morning. Thus, I'm *proper hyped* for a good day of work!

## Today's goal: refactor of the logging component 📜

Very back in the day — when this project started, really — I was tip-toeing my way around Vue and Javascript. I managed to implement a logging table, one that fetches content from our back-end API. It is currently somewhat hard-coded, as it will only fetch content from the previous half an hour, and fetches from a specific endpoint that will retrieve **all** logs.

So, I'd like to refactor it in two ways: the **endpoint** and the **time range** must be variables. And I suppose there are many ways to go at this! Right now, I'm focusing on *how to pass the arguments to the component*, and I think I'll pass them **from parent to child component as props**. 

After declaring the props on the child component `logsTable` (`props: ["username", "timeRange"]`), I do really start to see the benefits of TypeScript — I foresee issues with `timeRange`. Is it a single value? A tuple of Date elements? Who knows? Not even I! 😱

### Possible `timeRange` structures ⏳
- if it has one only element, get everything from the present moment until that moment (say, last half an hour; last day);
- if it has two elements `A` and `B`, get everything in between;
- there should be an easy way to select, on the parent component, a given time range (possibly with a calendar?);
