# {{ $page.title }}

*the following was written on* bocals-iMac, *at 10:45:54*.

Tough morning! In any case, here I am again. And moving forward, because...yeah? Time, and all.

Yesterday I had lots of good progress on the design part (which is practically finished, or a very decent MVP in the worst case scenario). For today, I'm planning on implementing proper filters.

## How to, Alex? 😲

Well, first maybe I should have a wide overlook over the current codebase. 

This is the relevant part from the blog component (and I actually notice *a very silly mistake*, but I'll see if it slides!):

```vue
<div class="blogPosts">
  <div class="post" v-for="post in posts">
	<div class="postInfo">
	  <router-link :to="post.path">{{
		post.frontmatter.title
	  }}</router-link>
	  <time style=""> {{ processedDate(post.frontmatter.date) }} </time>
	</div>
	<div>{{ post.frontmatter.description }}</div>
	<div class="postTags" v-if="'tags' in post.frontmatter">
	  <ul class="tag" v-for="tag in getTags(post.frontmatter.tags)">
		<li>{{ tag }}</li>
	  </ul>
	</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

So, the `for` look is quite important; it is looping over `posts`, which is a `computed` property. 

```vue
posts() {
  return this.$site.pages
	.filter((x) => x.path.startsWith("/blog/") && !x.frontmatter.blog_index)
	.sort(
	  (a, b) => new Date(b.frontmatter.date) - new Date(a.frontmatter.date)
	);
},
```

It seems like the `filter` is the most important part. As it is, it is taking all the content of `this.$site.pages` (more on that later, but I assume these are all the markdown files), and selecting everything whose path starts with `/blog/` and *is not* the blog index (which is a special file, identifiable by its frontmatter). So this is just *the default condition*; I feel like another condition can be appended with the logical *and*, in which tags could also be filtered. The `sort` is actually okay and works quite well. I'd still like the posts to appear in chronological order, so that is fine. 

As for the `$site` variable, that was quite confusing; there was a lot of contradictory information on the web. Is suppose the `$` stands for special variables of some sort. But to get more information, one can just easily render the `$site` variable — it's just a Javascript object with all the necessary information of the blog posts.

```
{"title": "Alex does the #100DaysOfCode 💥", "description": "", "base": "/", "headTags": [], "pages": [ { "title": "Alexandre thinks #100DaysOfCode is a really good idea...", "frontmatter": {}, "regularPath": "/", "relativePath": "README.md", "key": "v-6c545182", "path": "/", "headers": [ { "level": 2, "title": "To-Do (in the very near future)", "slug": "to-do-in-the-very-near-future" } ] }, { "title": "Day 35.5 - Proof of life 🌷", "frontmatter": { "title": "Day 35.5 - Proof of life 🌷", "date": "2022-01-10T00:00:00.000Z", "description": "I'm still alive, and very much kicking!", "tags": "musings" }, "regularPath": "/blog/011022.html", "relativePath": "blog/011022.md", "key": "v-6eef2f5c", "path": "/blog/011022.html", "headers": [ { "level": 2, "title": "The good stuff!", "slug": "the-good-stuff" }, { "level": 3, "title": "Icecast is up and running — really well, too! — and bzzzzzzz is now very responsive! 🛰", "slug": "icecast-is-up-and-running-really-well-too-and-bzzzzzzz-is-now-very-responsive-🛰" }, { "level": 3, "title": "My Javascript and front-end chops have increased immensely 🎨", "slug": "my-javascript-and-front-end-chops-have-increased-immensely-🎨" }, { "level": 3, "title": "It helped me keep track of things! And I feel my English has improved, too. ✍️", "slug": "it-helped-me-keep-track-of-things-and-i-feel-my-english-has-improved-too-✍️" },
```

### Working the code out 🏋️‍♂️

The `$site.pages` variable includes all the blog posts, and the tags are accessible through the `frontmatter` of each post. I'm keeping the aforementioned `posts` function, but with an extra condition. 

```vue
    posts() {
      return this.$site.pages
        .filter(
          (x) =>
            x.path.startsWith("/blog/") &&
            !x.frontmatter.blog_index &&
            (this.filteredTags == [] ||
              x.frontmatter.tags
                .toLowerCase()
                .split(",")
                .some((elem) => this.filteredTags.includes(elem.trim())))
        )
        .sort(
          (a, b) => new Date(b.frontmatter.date) - new Date(a.frontmatter.date)
        );
    },
```

(the formatting was done by the Prettier extension; it really might look *just a little better*).

Now, the above code wasn't working, and it took me a fair while to debug; only afterwards did I realise `this.filteredTags == []` is not a proper test for list emptyness; it works after testing for the length being zero. I can test the code is working by manually changing the `filteredTags` variable to include a few tags. 

**So what do I have so far?** a component that filters posts reactively according to a list of tags. **And what's the next step?** Be able to click the tags to filter!

### From child to parent component 🧒

I'm thinking of adding an event listener to every tag on the sidebar, making it emit information to the parent component, and enabling it to both toggle and untoggle a selection. 

<FetchComments :title=$frontmatter.title />
<PostComments :title=$frontmatter.title />
