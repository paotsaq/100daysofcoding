My mornings are still somewhat shaky, but it has been getting better!

## Emitting up! ðŸš€

As soon as the emits are handled, then all that is left to this is handling the cosmetic parts for good. This is very easy, but I wonder what could be the standard for naming emitted variables â€” there are a lot of moving parts. There's the variable on the child component, the emit event name, the variable on the parent component...it can get messy.

## That's done! You're so productive, Alex! ðŸ˜»

Yeah, thanks. The filter is working properly, and now we need to change the color of the tags as to signal they're selected; otherwise it gets messy too.

The tag elements are being rendered with a `v-for` loop.

```html
<div
  v-for="tagElement in allTags"
  class="tag"
  @click="activateTag(tagElement);changeTagColor(tagElement)"
  :data-tag="tagElement.InnerHTML"
>
  <li>{{ tagElement }}</li>
</div>
```

I forgot why I placed a `:data-tag` in there; it seems quite useless now, more so with the following code change: I bound the `id` of each element to the `tagElement` variable, with `v-bind:id="tagElement"`. The `changeTagColor` can just change the color of the tag back and forth!

```js
changeTagColor(tagElement) {
  let elem = document.getElementById(tagElement);
  if (this.selectedTags.includes(tagElement)) {
	elem.style["color"] = "white";
	elem.style["background"] = "var(--accentColor)";
  } else {
	elem.style["color"] = "#d9ffd2";
	elem.style["background"] = "#383737";
  }
},
```

notice how I used a `var(--accentColor)` there; `accentColor` is defined on a theme I'm using and it is better practice to resort to these, as the theme changes according to whether dark mode is active or not. So to avoid querying whether it is active or not, one can just use these variables which will change accordingly. So I dove deep into `node_modules/vuepress-theme-default-prefers-color-scheme/styles/index.styl`, where all of these are defined, and just had a go at figuring out some cool colors for the tags (the white theme is horrendous!).

Turns out it is not so easy to define new colors on that file, so I ended up defining some `:root` elements on the components. At the moment, there are duplicate CSS styles for both parent and child components â€” I'll get around to inheritance...eventually.

## It is done! (except for some CSS optimisation...)ðŸ¥³

Well, I'm calling it a day (or a couple of!) on this particular goal. The tags work, and they filter appropriately, but the style is still a little far from what I envisioned. That's okay, though, as I'll be moving my focus elsewhere for now.
