*the following was written on* bocals-iMac, *at 11:40:11*.

I started the week with some notes on stuff I had to take care of. One pertained the bzzzzzzz website (which will soon be bzzzzzzzz!), because it didn't properly route http to https. That was very quickly fixed â€” it seems like I was catching requests to bzzzzzzz.buzz instead of https://bzzzzzzz.buzz. So that's fixed â€” and it was quite easy too.

I'm not sure whether this interferes with the recurring playback issues I've been having, so I have to monitor this further. 

Well, today is going to be a rather busy day â€” there won't be much work done on the computer side of things. So I'll try to cram in some more c++.

## More c++ stuff!

Yesterday I glanced upon this piece of code 

```c++
// passing parameters by reference
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void duplicate (int& a, int& b, int& c)
{
  a*=2;
  b*=2;
  c*=2;
}

int main ()
{
  int x=1, y=3, z=7;
  duplicate (x, y, z);
  cout << "x=" << x << ", y=" << y << ", z=" << z;
  return 0;
}
```

which looks somewhat differently to what one would have with plain C. It looks good to receive `int &` instead of `int *` which one would then have to dereference. A nice touch!
