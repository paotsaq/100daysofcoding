To work at home â€” real home â€” is *much* harder. In times like this I really miss my polyphasic sleep phases, where everyone would be asleep and I could go on quietly at work. It is what it is, really â€” so let's dive right in with some further c++ acquaintance.

### A note about pointer arithmetics, and some other cool stuff!

I'm still following that guide, which is mostly revision stuff from C until it gets to classes: that's where c++ really has some new stuff. I found a cool part of the article, however, which highlights a feature which I feel is not too well understood (even by myself, sometimes) among the community.

Supposing these variables (which, note, are all pointers)

```c++
char *mychar;
short *myshort;
long *mylong;
```

one could apply the increment operator (`++`) to each, which would produce different *jumps in memory*, let's say. So `mychar` would be equal to `mychar + 1`, whereas `myshort` would jump two places in memory, and `mylong` would do four. This is quite neat, although very prone to confusion when the programmer is not aware!

### Regarding dynamic allocation of memory

It seems like there are a couple new operators: `new` seems to work much in the same way as `malloc` does in C. Apparently, in the case where an allocation will fail, an exception is thrown (much akin to Python!) and the program terminantes unless it is properly handled. 

There is also `delete`. Lots of cool stuff, really.

### Getting hands dirty with classes

In fact, my Python experience served as a pretty good introduction to object-oriented programming, and thus I feel most of this stuff is not really that big news.

Here's a great example from [the website I've been following](https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/classes/).

```c++
// example: one class, two objects
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Rectangle {
    int width, height;
  public:
    void set_values (int,int);
    int area () {return width*height;}
};

void Rectangle::set_values (int x, int y) {
  width = x;
  height = y;
}

int main () {
  Rectangle rect, rectb;
  rect.set_values (3,4);
  rectb.set_values (5,6);
  cout << "rect area: " << rect.area() << endl;
  cout << "rectb area: " << rectb.area() << endl;
  return 0;
}
```

All of this looks really standard. I think eveything whose scope is not explicitly defined will default to `private` â€” thus, the `width` and `height` parameters are not accessible outside of the class, which hopefully means one cannot manually set their values without the use of the `set_values` method. In Python, setting stuff to `private` cannot block programmers from setting the values manually: it is just a corteous way of letting them know *they should not be messing with the stuff*.

If the class should be initialised with values, c++ implemented Constructors. Quoting, 

```c++
This constructor function is declared just like a regular member function, but with a name that matches the class name and without any return type; not even void.
```

and thus the definition of the Rectangle class could have been changed to 

```c++
class Rectangle {
    int width, height;
  public:
    Rectangle (int,int);
    int area () {return (width*height);}
};
```

(in Python, this is similar to making use of the `__init__` method). With this, any new instance (object?) can be summoned as `Rectangle my_rectangle (3, 4)`, for example.

One could also overload the constructors â€” which is just a fancy way of playing with how the defaults work.

```c++
class Rectangle {
    int width, height;
  public:
    Rectangle ();
    Rectangle (int,int);
    int area (void) {return (width*height);}
};

Rectangle::Rectangle () {
  width = 5;
  height = 5;
}

Rectangle::Rectangle (int a, int b) {
  width = a;
  height = b;
}
```

In this case, if `Rectangle` is initialised without values, it will default to 5 on both its parameters. However, mind the difference:

```c++
Rectangle rectb;   // ok, default constructor called
Rectangle rectc(); // oops, default constructor NOT called 
```

There are many other ways to initialise info:

```c++
Rectangle::Rectangle (int x, int y) { width=x; height=y; }
Rectangle::Rectangle (int x, int y) : width(x) { height=y; }
Rectangle::Rectangle (int x, int y) : width(x), height(y) { }
```

I'm not crazy about either of these, so I suppose I'll just use the first initialisation structure.

## Oof! Enough theory. Let's solve stuff.

Alright, so there's been a whole lot of talk but not much of action. So I'm going to be solving some 42 c++ exercises to feel some progress.

In the first exercise, one must write a program that behaves as follows:

```c++
$>./megaphone "shhhhh... I think the students are asleep..."
SHHHHH... I THINK THE STUDENTS ARE ASLEEP...
$>./megaphone Damnit " ! " "Sorry students, I thought this thing was off."
DAMNIT ! SORRY STUDENTS, I THOUGHT THIS THING WAS OFF.
$>./megaphone
* LOUD AND UNBEARABLE FEEDBACK NOISE *
```

Contrary to what was previously the standard, built-in modules are now allowed, and we're encouraged to write in a c++ way (whatever that is!). 

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	if (argc == 1)
		std::cout << "* LOUD AND UNBEARABLE FEEDBACK NOISE *" << std::endl;
	else {
		for (int i = 1; i < argc; i++) {
			for (int j = 0; argv[i][j] != '\0'; j++)
				std::cout << (char)toupper(argv[i][j]);
		if (i != argc)
			std::cout << ' ';
		}
	std::cout << std::endl;
	}
}
```

This seems good enough!
