# {{ $page.title }}

Yesterday I spent the whole day in Porto ‚Äî we had some sort of fair to showcase the 42 school ‚Äî and thus, ended up not programming much. So that was a bummer.

Today, I'll be fixing some services, and making some notes for future progress on them. The Raspberry has been having some misc. issues with data handling, disk space and whatnot. For some reason, it doesn't properly update how full the disk is, which is not good, and a reboot won't solve it either.

## The current issue with `systemctl`.

Well, I use `systemctl` to interface with `systemd`, which handles all the services that start with the boot of the system. For some reason, `nginx` is being launched as a service ‚Äî which I do not want, right now, as I have another instance running containerised. So, `systemctl stop nginx` and then `systemctl disable nginx` will stop it from booting up ‚Äî which is nice!

After cleaning up some services that were no longer needed, I also set up a service to handle the Docker container of the website, which was nice. It now starts on boot, which was crazy not to have already.
