# {{ $page.title }}

I think I get makefiles, except for some parts which I do not understand. As with everything in life, really, which will for sure follow this formula. As of now, I need to have a proper grasp on it to implement the testing c++ framework; I want to finally be able to understand esoteric looking stuff like `OBJS:= $(SRCS:%.cpp=$(DIR_O)/%.o)`, and how to make it recompile only changed dependencies. It must not be impossible, right? So I'm following [this tutorial](https://makefiletutorial.com/), and jumping into some GNU documentation rabbitholes. üê∞ 

## Some stuff to remember later

### Definition of a rule üìè
I'm quoting very early in the GNU documentation. About rules,

::: tip Definition of rules
A rule appears in the makefile and says when and how to remake certain files, called the rule‚Äôs targets (most often only one per rule). It lists the other files that are the prerequisites of the target, and the recipe to use to create or update the target.
:::

This is important, because my compilation will usually recompile all the dependencies, even though the source code might have not changed.

Plus, we have that `The criterion for being out of date is specified in terms of the prerequisites, which consist of file names separated by spaces. A target is out of date if it does not exist or if it is older than any of the prerequisites (by comparison of last-modification times). `

### What's a Phony? ü§°

Now, phony is not just a light insult on frauds; it is a special way to declare that a target doesn't necessarily generate a file. This is useful, since Makefiles check whether the prerequisites of a file are newer than the target; it avoids running the rule otherwise. The GNU documentation has a great example on a `clean` rule, that removes object files (and has no prerequisites). If there is a file named `clean`, the rule will never run ‚Äî since there are no prerequisites, and the target file *exists*, `make` will skip its execution. Funny stuff!

```makefile
.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm *.o temp
```

### Static patterns, or *am I smart enough to understand this?* ü§î

So we get to the crux of Makefiles for me. Here follows the syntax of static patterns:

```
targets ‚Ä¶: target-pattern: prereq-patterns ‚Ä¶
        recipe
        ‚Ä¶
``` 



```makefile
foo.o : foo.c defs.h       # module for twiddling the frobs
        cc -c -g foo.c
```
