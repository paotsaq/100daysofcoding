One thing that still bugs me with this blog is how frequently I must track back to finish a previous day's entry. Whole subjects might get abruptly trimmed by one of the great many circumstances of life, and that is *not good*. So I'm thinking every blog post should have something akin to a boolean flag, indicating whether that particular daily endeavour was properly accounted for.
This would be useful for the previous post, for example, which was cut off without any decent conclusion ‚Äî and even a way to keep track of posts lineage (day X following day Y) would be good!

Ah, plenty of ideas. Let's see about all that! I'll make a to-do note on this (to-do notes, in fact, should be automated as well).
