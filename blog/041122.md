One thing that still bugs me with this blog is how frequently I must track back to finish a previous day's entry. Whole subjects might get abruptly trimmed by one of the great many circumstances of life, and that is *not good*. So I'm thinking every blog post should have something akin to a boolean flag, indicating whether that particular daily endeavour was properly accounted for.
This would be useful for the previous post, for example, which was cut off without any decent conclusion ‚Äî and even a way to keep track of posts lineage (day X following day Y) would be good!

Ah, plenty of ideas. Let's see about all that! I'll make a to-do note on this (to-do notes, in fact, should be automated as well).

## Changing url upon page loading on `vue-router` üí®

### Checking the documentation for the changes üìö

This has been an issue on the Vue project for a while: inside the view which selects different student profiles, the URL never changes. This is bad, because it won't allow for the intuitive *backward motion* in the browser's history.

A brief ducking ([hehe ü¶Ü](https://duckduckgo.com)) reveals some informative documentation on [Dynamic Route Matching](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/dynamic-matching.html). It seems like the example is a total fit on my case (`we may have a User component which should be rendered for all users but with different user IDs`); it does, however, call for checking whether my `vue-router` setup is proper, too ‚Äî it has been a long while since we implemented it in the project.

As it is, this is the setup:

```vue
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import router from './router'

createApp(App).use(router).mount('#app')
```

where `./router` goes for another file, which defines the `routes` object.

```vue
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/',
    name: 'Dashboard',
    component: Home
  },
  {
    path: '/users',
    name: 'Users',
    component: Users
  },
  {
    path: '/logs',
    name: 'Logs',
    component: Logs
  },
]
```

The documentation offers the following example:

```vue
const User = {
  template: '<div>User</div>',
}

// these are passed to `createRouter`
const routes = [
  // dynamic segments start with a colon
  { path: '/users/:id', component: User },
]
```

thus, I imported the component, defining the route along the way:

```js
  {
	path: "/users/:id",
    name: "showUser",
    component: showUser,
  },
```

now, this component is having its `id` (the user, in this case) passed as a prop from another View. Since this task is being delegated to the router instance, there's some refactoring to do. Both the `User` view and the `showUser` view need changes; I'll handle the latter first, because I need to check whether the browser history is adapting properly.

### Adapting the component to receive params from `vue-router` üß≥

Since the route was defined with the `:id` param, I'm expecting to be able to expose it using the `$route.params` variable. So, a quick injection of 

```html
  <h3 class="text-4xl my-5 font-semibold">User Information</h3>
  {{ $route.params }}
  <div class="flex flex-row">
	  ...
  </div>
```

allows for checking that, indeed, entering `/users/testUser` will display `testUser` as a variable corresponding to `id`. This is good!

There's another issue, though, which stems from my lacking (but slowly improving!) knowledge of Vue: I can access `$route.params` on the template, but all my template code relies on the `intraUsername` variable (which is a prop). So, I know I can (literally) change all occurences of X to Y, but it seems a better practice to handle the `$route.params` outside of the template ‚Äî thus, on the scripting part. In other words, I want to keep `intraUsername` as it is.

```js
created() {
	this.intraUsername = this.$route.params.id;
}
```

It feels so good to *finally* feel confident with Vue. The `created()` function, as defined in the `<script></script>` body, will run code after the component is created. One can learn more about these special functions with the [Vue component lifecycle hooks documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/lifecycle.html#registering-lifecycle-hooks). And this works, without changing much of the code!

### Adapting the parent component to send params with `vue-router` üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüë¶

Now this is going to be trickier. My `Users` view actually just renders one component or the other; but this can change, as the `showUser` doesn't rely on props anymore, and I could instead just have `searchUser` as a "main" view and discard this one altogether.

```html
<template>
  <h1 class="text-5xl my-5 font-semibold">Users</h1>
  <div class="users_parent">
    <searchUser v-if="selectedUser == null" @selectUsername="selectedUser = $event"/>
    <showUser v-else @clearUsername="selectedUser = null" :intraUsername="selectedUser"/>
  </div>
</template>
```

`searchUser`, on the other hand, renders every search result as a button that, upon clicking, emits the desired user to the parent component;

```vue
    <button
      class="bg-green-400"
      v-for="(r, i) in aresults"
      :key="i"
      :data-Intra42Login="r.Intra42Login"
      v-on:click="emitLogin(r.Intra42Login)"
    >
```

If `searchUser` gets to be the main page, then all that's needed is to apply a routing on button click. This will greatly simplify the code!

Again, it feels more natural to modify `searchUser` first. Just changing it to

```vue
  v-on:click="this.$router.push({ name: 'showUser', params: { id: r.Intra42Login} })"
```

will do the trick. *Is Vue easy?! ü§Ø*
