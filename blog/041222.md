*the following was written on* bocals-iMac, *at 09:51:39*.

It really makes sense to implement some sort of lineage. Having tags *sort of works*, but doesn't necessarily allow for segueing from a post into the next. 

[*me thinking out loud*]

Every post starts with a vim snippet that introduces a frontmatter and the comments section; say I want to reference a previous post â€” I could then easily do a `follows: XX` area, which would mean a post is following day XX. There's a problem, however, in that it won't trigger a `followed by: YY` on day XX.

In fact, the quickest solution could be a simple (Python?) script that takes two days **from the standard input**, and edits the files accordingly â€” this seems much easier than trying to fight Vuex (state management) into the tight Vuepress framework. Nothing too fancy. How about a text file, `lineage.txt`, which holds all lineages? This would avoid standard input, which is always a mess.

And *when* to run this script, too? The current workflow is to write the blog posts, commit them, and then push to a git repository; this could probably be automated, too.
