I got the framework working yesterday ‚Äî there were some very late edits to [day 60](https://www.alexmakes.codes/blog/040822.html)... ‚Äî and am now ready to tackle the proper design of tests.

## The first test: redirecting output from `stdout` to a string.

The exercise is about designing something akin to a contact book. One can introduce contact fields, and then ensure these are properly stored and what not. So I devised a class method to attribute the contact fields, and I want to ensure these work; 

So this is the test:

```c++
TEST_GROUP(testContacts)
{
	Contact newContact;

	void setup()
	{
		newContact.assignFirstName("Alex");
		newContact.assignLastName("Pinto");
		newContact.assignNickName("fadadolar");
		newContact.assignNumber("9191991919");
		newContact.assignDarkestSecret("a programming fraud");
	}

	void teardown()
	{

	}
};

TEST(testContacts, canStoreContactInfo)
{
    std::stringstream ss;

	const char *expected = 
	"First name: Alex\n"
	"Last name: Pinto\n"
	"Nick name: fadadolar\n"
	"Phone number: 9191991919\n"
	"Darkest Secret: a programming fraud\n";
						
    //change the underlying buffer and save the old buffer
	auto old_buf = std::cout.rdbuf(ss.rdbuf()); 

	newContact.displayContact(); 

    std::cout.rdbuf(old_buf); 

	STRCMP_EQUAL(expected, ss.str().c_str());
}

```

The cool part is `auto old_buf = std::cout.rdbuf(ss.rdbuf());`, which is throwing around `rdbuf()` left and right. These shenanigans are best understood when reading [the reference pages](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ios/ios/rdbuf/).

With this, I can catch console prints that would otherwise go to `stdout`, and use it to compare with whatever I want. I wonder if one can also simulate `stdin`?

```c++
TEST(testContacts, canReceiveContactInfoFromStdin)
{
	FAIL("Learn to simulate stdin!");
}
```

until I get to learning how to solve that particular issue, this is the test for now. ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## That was cheating! Time for some proper TDD üß©

So, the whole deal about TDD (Test-Driven Development) is to work the code in sure, short steps; and one would devise the tests *before* producing the actual code, which is not what happened just now. To do it properly, one should 

1. devise a test (which the code fails, *because there's no code yet*);
2. work the code to pass the test (avoid premature optimisation ‚Äî just aim for passing the test);
3. refactor accordingly (generalise, optimise, etc.);

This is the gist of it ‚Äî of course, there's more (and better) resources than my personal, unexperienced biased take on TDD.

In this case, I want to implement the following feature in my Contacts application:

``` Display the saved contacts as a list of 4 columns: index, first name, last name and nickname.
Each column must be 10 characters wide. A pipe character (‚Äô|‚Äô) separates them. The text must be right-aligned. If the text is longer than the column, it must be truncated and the last displayable character must be replaced by a dot (‚Äô.‚Äô).
```

There's going to be a function, say `displaySavedContacts()`, that will, upon call, display the contacts as such:

```
     INDEX|FIRST NAME| LAST NAME|  NICKNAME
         1|      Alex|Alexeyiov.| fadadolar
```

But to break this behaviour into smaller functions, there could be a simple function called `displayTruncatedString(string)`, that receives any string and displays its truncated form; so that is where I'm starting from. 

*[15 minutes after]*

It is done! Good. I won't be posting all the tests, all the time ‚Äî otherwise my productivity is very heavily set back, too. But this is going well!
