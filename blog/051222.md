I have great reasons for my absence: it was really a hectic month ‚Äî many stage performances to be pulled! ‚Äî and naturally, logging my programming endeavours was neglected. To be fair, there was, too, much less programming than usual...but I'm getting back on track **today**!

There's not much to add, really. I've been assigned a relatively urgent task of fetching information from a database (lots of statistics!), and I also have to fix some past projects to submit at the school. Hopefully this will help me get a little better organised for the forthcoming couple of months, which will entail lots of changes in my life: I'll be moving out to Porto (goodbye Lisbon! It has been quite fun so far!), but there are also two stand-up performances very very soon ‚Äî and that is, too, a new experience for me. So lot's of exciting stuff, I suppose!
