# {{ $page.title }}

So, a couple days ago I managed to fix all the issues of the other 42 project - apparently, there's a `-fsanitize=threads` flag 🤯 which means that this new week ahead is prone to a great planning! Let's see how it pans out.

## Current situation with the cards platform 🧩

As you might be aware, there's a developing project over at the school — I'm handling the front-end for a service which allows for more control over the card authentication system in the premises (think tourniquettes, and all that). As of now, it allows for control over blocking cards, checking card activity, and attributing new cards; it communicates with our own back-end, which is wrapping over the card system. In the past couple of days, however, we realised the need for a statistical analysis on this data; and this seems like a quite fun exercise! 

There are some possibilities of paths and frameworks. As of now, the front-end is developed in Vue, and I didn't yet think of any real reason to introduce another player in the scene, so to say; I'm thinking on letting the front-end handle everything (mind you, this is an application designed for internal consumption only! So no worries about scaling, etc.; and of course my first instinct was to bring some Python onto this, but that's wholly unnecessary).

I'll be signaling `IN` for a record of a student coming in the campus; `OUT` is the student going outbound.

## The objectives 🏁

What we are currently aiming at is:

- average number of students in school / day; 
- average number of students in school / week; 
- average number of weekly hours spent in school per student that has been in school at least once in that week

I suppose a possible workflow could be:
- filter students from the database;
- filter those who have an `IN` during the day;
- look for the corresponding `OUT` — the system is fallible because two could happen: the student might leave without clocking out, and/or might have an `IN` record again (because there was no proper clocking out).
- count the time between `IN` and `OUT` records, and devise a strategy to deal with fallible records (use the student mean to fill in the record?)

so... that's a start! 🥳

I do have an additional worry, though: we'll be looking at many log records at any given time, and I wouldn't want to overload neither the front-end device memory nor the back-end. In fact, I have no clue how intensive these computations might get, as there will be some data plotting at a later date 🥵 I feel there's at least one possible mitigation manoeuvre (ha! I know some silly words too!), which would be to pull all the data in advance every time the front-end is loaded — this might imply using a *store*, which I haven't yet. There's lots to look ahead to! 🛣

## The testing 👷‍♂️

Now, you know I'm getting quite obsessed with testing, and this feels no different. I don't think I can deal with the anxiety of jumping into a project without any sort of roadmap, and unit testing is a great tool for that matter. In this case, the tests feel a little awkward because the back-end is feeding me data from a database built from live card data; that is not too convenient, because I have no clue about which data it is turning out, and I am also relying on the back-end's good behaviour in fetching it.

It feels much more sane
