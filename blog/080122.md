# {{ $page.title }}

Well, well well - the week starts with a foray into shell scripting and whatnot.

I'm currently at 42Porto. We have many computers running some tasks that need to be periodically manually killed: they're spawned, and they're useful, but at some point they're not finishing, thus consuming the CPU's resources and, were it not enough, raising the temperature and driving the fans to very high speeds. So this has to be dealt with.

We're thinking a proper course of action could be to deploy a `cron` job with a shell script, which would identify the PID of the offending tasks and pipe it to a kill. These would be put on the machines through something like Ansible â€” but we'll get to that eventually.

```

(this is not an offending machine; just for the sake of the example, I'll be using my own).

I devised a simple Python script that would correctly parse and get the offending PIDs, which were then killed through another shell interaction from the script. Initially, I thought about using `awk`

# Deploying with Ansible ðŸ’Œ

This part was rather easy as well. Ansible deals with playbooks, which have a very particular structure, and I just went with another one as an example. This playbook turned out to be very simple â€” mostly just copying a file from my computer to the 150-ish I have available.

```yaml
- hosts: all
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Create a script for killing deepthough processes
	  template:
	    src: campus_files/etc/kill_deepthought.py
		dest: /etc/kill_deepthought.py
		force: no
```

Ansible logging is thorough. After having deployed the file, running is quite simple as well.

```
ansible all -m shell -a "python3 /etc/kill_deepthought.py"
```
