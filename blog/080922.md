I'm a rather lazy person. Not only that, I'm also disorganised too, which is a rather unpleasant combination for someone who's trying to thrive in the IT scene, or whatever. And with the busy days I've been having, of course the automatic Let's Encrypt emails, all about my soon-to-be-expiring SSL certificate, would be dutifully ignored.

As you might or not recall, my current *bzzzzz* setup is quite convoluted â€” there's a Docker architecture commanding an nginx instance that reverse proxies some sibling containers (such fancy talk for someone *so inexperienced in these wanderings!*); this makes it so that running Certbot is a little more cumbersome, as it can be quite a hassle to have the binary run *inside* the container, or in an image alongside them. 

I recall having gone through this very same issue a couple of months ago â€” and past Alexandre did not do his proper job at documenting the issue â€” which was *very frustrating*. But I had some hints on how to proceed, just from memory alone. 

For future reference, here's what's happening: my docker nginx instance is sourcing certificates placed at my Raspberry's system level `/etc/letsencrypt/`; it was enough to spin a local `nginx` server with a barebones, *definitely-production-unready* local flask server, and a system level certbot as well â€” and it worked like a charm. Oof.
