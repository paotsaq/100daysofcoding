These have been some busy days ‚Äî again ‚Äî so I haven't had much time nor discipline to sit down for a couple of hours and work my way through SICP. But today I took some time to work in a exercise I was stuck in: [Exercise 2.20](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf)


What I'll usually do is try my own take at the exercise, then try to make it work with a little less code, and finally look up the [SICP Solutions Wiki](http://community.schemewiki.org/?sicp-ex-2.20) (which really is a godsend, considering I'm attending no classes and doing this on my own). And Scheme has its quirks. I'm running Guile as a REPL for Scheme and the debug information really is no good, so debugging these programs really does take a while. On the other hand, it makes me be a little more careful with the assumptions I'm making on regarding Scheme's syntax.

So, just for the sake of examples, here's two takes on the same exercise

```scheme
(define (same-parity-first leading . arg-list)
  (define lead-parity (remainder leading 2))
  (define (build-list arg-list)
    (if (null? arg-list))
        '()
        (if (= (remainder (car arg-list) 2)
               lead-parity)
            (append (list (car arg-list))
                    (build-list (cdr arg-list)))
            (build-list (cdr arg-list)))))
  (append (list leading)
          (build-list arg-list)))
```

This is top-down recursive.


```scheme
(define (same-parity first . rest)
  (define (same-parity-iter res numbers parity)
    (if (null? numbers)
      res
      (same-parity-iter
       (if (= (remainder (car numbers) 2) parity)
           (append res (list (car numbers)))
           res)
       (cdr numbers)
       parity)))
  (same-parity-iter (list first) rest (remainder first 2)))
```

This is iteratively solving the same problem, although it still uses recursive calls to the same function. However, since the result is being passed as a parameter to the function at every call, it actually takes less space in memory to perform. Funky stuff, heh?
