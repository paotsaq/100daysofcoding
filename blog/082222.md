# {{ $page.title }}

*the following was written on* lardafada, *at 11:27:32*.

I woke up and almost immediately logged onto the machine; I had yesterday's exercise to tackle (reverse lists, but in which the elements might be lists as well) and most likely problems to solve at 42 as well.

# Fixing getting clipboard content over SSH 📮

This had been a source of frustration for a while, now. Whenever I logged into a machine through SSH, it was extremely complicated to get its content to my clipboard. With time, I realised this would have to happen at a terminal level (I use `kitty`). Well, it took me *way too long* to just go ahead and google it. It seems like the best solution is to enable `copy_on_select yes` on my `kitty.conf`, and now it behaves exactly as one assumes: if I select with mouse on the remote machine, it goes into the main frame's clipboard. Intended use! 🙌

# Another scheme exercise 

Produce `deep-reverse` as such:

```scheme
(define x (list (list 1 2) (list 3 4)))
x
((1 2) (3 4))
(reverse x)
((3 4) (1 2))
(deep-reverse x)
((4 3) (2 1))
```

Well, this was, again, rather easy, except for the misc. syntax errors that seem to plague my unexperienced Scheme skills.

```scheme
(define (deep-reverse args)
  (define (iter-proc res args)
    (if (null? args)
        res
        (iter-proc (if (list? (car args))
                       (append (list (deep-reverse (car args)))
                              res)
                       (append (list(car args))
                              res))
                   (cdr args))))
  (iter-proc (list) args))
```

This is a reasonable solution. But a quick peek into the SICP solutions reveals the most elegant one — it aches me so much to not have thought of this! 🥲

```scheme
(define (pretty-deep-reverse args)
   (if (pair? args)
       (reverse (map pretty-deep-reverse args))
       args))

(pretty-deep-reverse x)
```

Although, of course, it makes use of the built-in `reverse`.
