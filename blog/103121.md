### Today's achievements ⬇️
- progressed the raycaster to the debugging phase ⚙️ 
- partially implemented a dark-mode 🌓
- fixed both the picture and the styling on the About page 🎈

# The raycaster in stuck on debugging phase - yay...? 🙃

The progress in the last couple of days was bound to stop as soon as the code compiled and ran. To be fair, compilation wasn't that big of a deal - all the variables are packed in a structure that is currently overloaded, and bursting at the seams 🤫 the proper algorithm, however, is failing big time. It is all a sequence of arithmetic operations on somewhat abstract values, spouting results that are not immediately comprehensible. It calls for a thorough debug process...which I am glad to leave for future Alexandre to handle. 🤸‍♀️

# The website now (partially) supports dark-mode!

The lack of a proper dark-mode will trigger very physical reactions - specially when using a computer late at night (which shouldn't happen to often, but alas...). I've been keen on implementing a solution over at [the bzzzzzzz project](https://bzzzzzzz.buzz), but the lack of proper JS knowledge always derails my best intents.

On this particular project, however, I feel more at ease rummaging through the internet for my very specific problems. I found a very quick and easy implementation by [tolking](https://github.com/tolking/vuepress-theme-default-prefers-color-scheme); it depends on the `default-prefers-color-scheme` browser directive, which can be accessed by the front-end code using a Javascript query of some sort. From what I understand, it's set to become part of the standard of handling dark modes - at least on Mac OS, its value is directly fed from the System Preferences toggle on the Appearance preferences. 

This is not the ideal solution - or, better put, it *can't be the only solution* - because it depends both on this very recent browser standard, and renders the user mute on its personal preferences. Thus, I am working to equip a proper toggle that can manually override this default behaviour. It will come soon, I suppose, because it depends on...

# ...figuring out what is the best stack for this website 🤔

As a matter of fact, my current version of Vuepress is very outdated - there's the upcoming **VuePress 2** release, and the **VitePress** project, and probably many more other options. [Some Vuepress themes](https://github.com/vuepress-theme-hope/vuepress-theme-hope) sort of implement many of the features I want out of the box - like blog comments! - which would save me a lot of time and work.

Going for vanilla builds should allow for deeper acquaintance with both Javascript and Vue; on the other hand, practicing stack migrations is useful, and one ought not to get too attached to any particular stack in this ever-changing Javascript world. For now, portability of content should be prioritised.

As the project progresses, the need for more complex interactions may come about (designing API calls, proper Vue components, etc.). So we will see how that goes.

# Some ideas for the future:
### a to-do list
it should come in handy. To make it a little more interesting, the content could be handled on another server, communicating through an API;
### a front-end for server interactions
I have been maintaining a server for many years; it handles ~~my torrenting~~, and another website. Interaction with it, however, depends on SSH communication, where data transmission occurs through `scp` commands. This is not practical at all - even content queries are made through these very primitive tools. Bash scripting could be circumvented with Python, which would then serve content, again, through an API.

### And for tomorrow... ⬇️
- at least a further hour with the raycaster 🙃
