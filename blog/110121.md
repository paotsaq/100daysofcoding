### Today's situation ⬇️
very poor night of sleep - programming capabilities are definitely impaired 😩 that being said, I'll take a slight detour from the usual day of work.

# Tackling two ideas for the immediate future 💡
Yesterday let off some ideas for future features (yes - say it out loud 🤓) and one in particular - the **To-Do list** - strikes me as a very good exercise for now. It could automatically fetch items from these blog posts (which solves the data input) and then present it on the main page. It should be easy to implement, as it is a quintessential front-end exercise with plenty of tutorials and other resources available on the web.

Another cool possible feature: a **graphical display of how my programming time gets distributed**. This would probably involve proper categorisation of all the programming tasks I have entailed. Since all these blog posts are really just Markdown files, all that's needed is some Vim macros for a quick solution - later on, a more sophisticated approach could involve user authentication and front-end manual input. 

# Practicing... development best-pratices 🙃
A great motivation for this #100DaysOfCode project was the increased accountability and organisation that comes with regular note-taking: putting a plan down on (not literal) paperunburdens my future self from having to make decisions *while coding*; all the efforts can be placed on executing the plan instead. So, I hereby establish a very crude roadmap for this project 🔽

### 1. draft the HTML and CSS for the to-do list;
Simple things first: have a quick vanilla-CSS prototype up-and-running; later on, it can be improved using proper CSS frameworks (like Tailwind CSS). Ideally, it will respect **Mobile-First design** - one of my major webdesign shortcomings is the lack of responsive design knowledge.
### 2. change the landing page to (statically) provide the table element;
Everything is still updated manually, but any website visitor can immediately benefit from more content.
### 3. transition the landing page into a Vue component;
This is where implementation issues may arise, as VuePress has many possibilities for Vue component integration.
### 4. fetch the component content from each Markdown file;
VuePress provides very interesting Markdown behaviours with [**Custom Containers**](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown.html#custom-containers).

### And for tomorrow... ⬇️
- finalise implementation of the to-do list;
- mess with the raycaster a little, to keep the hang of it.
