### About the long absence... üåÉ

When I agreed with past-Alexandre about undertaking the #100DaysOfCode challenge, I was aware that, sometimes, life happens - and hopefully I will take some very personal lessons from *life happening* for almost a whole week. That was not too good, and most of the blame is on past, really-not-on-present Alexandre! ü§´

An hour a day is perfectly doable - regularity is, after all, part of the point of this whole exercise. 

# ...and the whole Icecast situation! üì°

Having a local Icecast broadcast working really was a milestone - but, in hindsight, it feels like it could have been done much sooner. But however excited I might be about the project, the sanest next step would be to encapsulate the whole Raspberry setup in a proper Docker build.

As of now, the Raspberry is responsible for hosting the [bzzzzzzz.buzz](https://bzzzzzzz.buzz) website, and running a torrenting client; since the Micro SD card of the Raspberry is very frail, there is an [external boot protocol](https://raspiserver.com/how-to-boot-from-external-hdd-on-raspberry-pi/) implemented to protect it from failing so often; and there are some services running - `nginx`, `ufw`, `mpd`, etc. - that need to be reinstalled with every incarnation of my server.

So a good first step would be to setup a Docker image on my own computer, and both configure and test it before deployment. Should be fun!

# Snippets are implemented!

[*a lot of time has passed since the aforemented title and the following:*]

I had snippets installed through NeoVim. I swear some people can probably get this working no sweat involved, but every time I install a Vim plugin it crashes. This time, the error message is somewhat easier to read (I think it involves Python somehow?), and to be honest it seems easy to, at least, revert to the original Vim. 

You're probably thinking: *what do you mean, revert*. They're distributed differently, of course. But I had the very bright idea of *aliasing* `nvim` with the `vim` keyword. Thanks, smart Alexandre! üëç
