# {{ $page.title }}

Today, I'll be following [**Fullstack Vue 3: The Complete Guide to Vue.js**](https://www.newline.co/vue/), by Hassan Djirdeh, Nate Murray and Ari Learner. A couple months ago, this was my Vue learning resource, and I made it maybe a quarter or a third in. It is good - but I need to make my own notes. Thus, this is an attempt at that.

# Basics of a component in Vue ðŸŒ±

In Vue, Components are essential building blocks, that can be utilised across the code. Components can be single files (with a `.vue` extension), encompassing three different contents: the `template`, which contains all HTML structure, the `script`, handling interaction with other components or Javascript implementations (?), and the `style`, containing all the CSS styling for the particular component.

In the case of the to-do list, it will be a component embed in the main page.

```html
<template>
...
</template>

<script>
...
</script>

<style>
...
</style>
```

# Creating a data model for the to-do app

To simplify things, the content of the to-do list will be put in a separate file. For now, this is the easiest solution. Following the book's first chapter, a Javascript file would be created, containing an array of Javascript objects (very akin to dictionaries in Python); however, I'm not entirely sure how to access Vue's ***Application Instance*** on VuePress. [This website has info on how to render a .json file](https://vuepress-examples.netlify.app/demos/local/), which is exactly what I need, and after slightly adapting the code, a possible solution arises.

```html
<template>
  <table id="to-do">
    <tr v-for="item in items">
	<td>{{item.description}}</td>
	<td>{{item.motivation}}</td>
	<td>{{item.technologies}}</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</template>

<script>
import data from './../../to_do.json'
export default {
  data () {
      return {
          items: data,
	      };
	},
};
</script>
```

This works!

I spent some time debugging, so here are some tips:
- make sure to always check the `console log` of the browser;
- in this case, I implemented the to-do table as a component. VuePress' component path is `.vuepress/components/<ComponentFilename>`. Make sure to use `ComponentFilename` when importing!

As of now, the to-do list is being rendered from an external `.json` file. Not ideal, but better than being 100% hardcoded! ðŸŽ‰
