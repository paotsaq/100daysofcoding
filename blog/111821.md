After a couple of hours of messing with the raycaster, I finished my yesterday with some shell scripting: I have for long wished to implement a better alternative to this command, that occurs frequently in my workflow:

```bash
scp -r pi@bzzzzzzz.buzz:/media/externalhdd/downloads/Debussy,\\\ Klavierwerke\\\ -\\\ Weissenberg\\\ \\\(1986\\\)\\\ \\\[FLAC\\\]\\\ \\\{DG\\\ 445\\\ 547-2\\\} ~/Desktop
```

What's this, I hear you ask (not in a literal way, of course)? Well, my Raspberry Pi is hosting a (very legal!) torrenting client (and for very legal content!); and for every downloaded torrent, the aforementioned command must be run. Since this all happens on a shell command line, I usually autocomplete from `scp`, which will display the last download, and everything from `/downloads/` onwards must be (manually, and very slowly) removed to make place for whatever I want to download next. It is, of course, not ideal, and very much prone to being automated.
