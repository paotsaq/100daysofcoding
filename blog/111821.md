After a couple of hours of messing with the raycaster, I finished my yesterday with some shell scripting: I have for long wished to implement a better alternative to this command, that occurs frequently in my workflow:

```bash
scp -r pi@bzzzzzzz.buzz:/media/externalhdd/downloads/Debussy,\\\ Klavierwerke\\\ -\\\ Weissenberg\\\ \\\(1986\\\)\\\ \\\[FLAC\\\]\\\ \\\{DG\\\ 445\\\ 547-2\\\} ~/Desktop
```

# Very fun adventures with shell 🤸🏻‍♂️

What's this, I hear you ask (not in a literal way, of course)? Well, my Raspberry Pi is hosting a (very legal!) torrenting client (and for very legal content!); and for every downloaded torrent, the aforementioned command must be run. Since this all happens on a shell command line, I usually autocomplete from `scp`, which will display the last download, and everything from `/downloads/` onwards must be (manually, and very slowly) removed to make place for whatever I want to download next. It is, of course, not ideal, and very much prone to being automated.

*(there's still some points to cover in the post, and I'm running quite late; so I'll just add that)* if you feel this is somewhat cumbersome to put into words, take the liberty to imagine just how slightly nervewracking it is to communicate issues with implementing this particular code - seems easy, right? 🙃 But there are many small issues and language miscommunications, to say the least.

The first one happened with shell language itself. Apparently, variable attributions must be done with no spaces between variable name and content, ie. `x=42` will work much, much better than `x = 42`; and the whole script started working only after changing to `$($x)` from `$($(x))`. Lots of fun! 👺

...it is now running on the Raspberry! Still need to properly access the mount points, though - and even the admin page itself. Should be easy!
