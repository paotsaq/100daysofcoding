# {{ $page.title }}

Today I produced very interesting and impressive programming metrics - 641 lines of code in just shy of four hours ðŸ¤¯ it was intense, but I won't provide many details into it (very sorry - but it's really not that interesting, I swear. And it was Python!).

In fact, now that the academic season is really picking up (as the evaluation period is fast approaching college students), it is likely that my days will be progressively contaminated by private tutoring on languages and particular projects. Luckily, I find this very fun and rewarding - and, of course, it helps paying the bills! ðŸ’°

As I mentioned this to a colleague, he said that freelance work is very akin to this sort of short-tasks-with-tight-deadlines; it made me wonder what the demand is for Python freelance work, maybe in building API or deploying microservices, or even automating some processes. Maybe some opportunities may arise in a near future?
