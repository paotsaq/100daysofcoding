# {{ $page.title }}

I want to get tags working. This will help immensely with tracking down content in past posts - plus, it's probably very easy to set up a quick graph that shows how I allocate my time across all the undergoing projects.

The blog posts are rendered through Markdown files, and all the parsing is handled with Vuepress; this means I don't really have access to whatever is happening under the hood. I do have, on the other hand, a `frontmatter` to every blogpost; it's easy to add a `tags` line, and place them separated by commas.

```

(notice the subtle space behind the `b` in blog - that will be handled too!)

All that's due is changing the Blog component to access the tags (using `post.frontmatter.tags `), split them (`getTags(tagsLine) {return tagsLine.split().map(x => x.trim())`), and then render these separately: 

```html 
<div class="post" v-for="post in posts">
	<div class="postInfo">
		<router-link :to="post.path">{{ post.frontmatter.title }}</router-link>
		<time style=""> {{ processedDate(post.frontmatter.date) }} </time>
	</div>
	<div>{{ post.frontmatter.description }}</div>
	<div class="tags" v-if="'tags' in post.frontmatter">
		<div class="tag" v-for="tag in getTags(post.frontmatter.tags)">
			{{ tag }}
		</div>
	</div>
</div>
```
