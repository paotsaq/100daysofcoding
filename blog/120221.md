## Life is cool, heh?

How is everyone else doing? Hopefully, good — but be wary and mindful, regarding the pandemic. Let's be kind to one another! 🙌

Life happened for a while; I mean, not that programming is not *a life, in itself*, but actual life *outside* of programming. To be fair, there was actually some computer stuff done, but it was mostly *optimisation of an interface* rather than real code.

## I did receive some feedback regarding this little Vue component below ⏬
<CommentsStub/>

...but couldn't properly respond to it until now. In fact, not even *right now* — but will do it soon, and very much appreciate the care!

### Things to do:
- scraper for Facebook video content;
- bug with nvim; global register is exporting badly? Unicode gets botched.

## Advent of Code

Having been out these last three days or so, I missed the start of the Advent of Code initiative — I am already two days behind. The exercises are all in good fun, but they can get quite challenging after maybe 10 days in: in fact, I apparently quit after day 10, but to be fair, last year's December was very, very busy. 

I hope to be able to make it further this time around, or at least the 10 exercises of last years'. The global discourse built around AoC is quite elegant and informative to spend time with.

However — just as it so irrationally happens with some other endeavours of mine — why not make this *much harder than needed*, using Lisp instead of the much-more-comfortable Python?

Let's see!
