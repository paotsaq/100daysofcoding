## Some brief Javascript practice... ðŸŽ¯

I'm still tackling some Exercism exercises, as I don't want to skip any steps until getting to requests and promises and what not. I got a bit stuck during this very easy exercise: 

```js
quantities(['sauce', 'noodles', 'sauce', 'meat', 'mozzarella', 'noodles']);
// => { noodles: 100, sauce: 0.4 }
```

...mostly because I went for something close to a functional solution, instead of hard-coding the result dictionary. This is what I have as a result:

```js
function quantities(qts) {
  var res = {};
  let ingrs = {'sauce': 0.2, 'noodles': 50};
  Object.keys(ingrs).forEach(x => res[x] = qts.filter(y => y === x).length * ingrs[x]);
  return res;
}
```

I'd like to have two lines instead of four, possibly omitting the object definition of ``var res = {}``; I also had some trouble submitting this solution to the Exercism platform, as I used `ingrs.keys()` instead of `Object.keys(ingrs)`.
