I notice that it has been a while since I did anything not webdev related - at least on this blog.

## Understanding Axios 🤔

As I get more and more comfortable with *getting things done* in front-end, some things still elude me. Suppose the POST request to the back-end fails; in that case, I don't think it is a good idea to display a success message (🤦‍♂️), nor to erase the contents of the comment. But to get that information, the code must react to the Axios requests; and that, according to some searches 🕵️‍♂️ is the task of an **Axios interceptor**.

[As per the Axios github](), "*You can intercept requests or responses before they are handled by `then` or `catch`*" -- and this is tremendously useful! For starters, I'll be logging the requests to the console, and with further progress it will be used to distinguish between successful and failed requests. Interceptors are **set up once**, and are used for every request afterwards. If one sets up, say,

```js
axios.interceptors.request.use(req => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  return req;
});

```
every request will be logged to the console (code by [mastering JS](https://masteringjs.io/tutorials/axios/interceptors)).

## Making the GET request to fetch comments! 📫

Alright: before even *thinking* about POSTing comments, it might be a good idea to be able to fetch them in the first place. With this implementation in mind, I actually learned a couple of useful things for the future. 

Every Vue component has a lifecycle. `mounted` is a particularly useful one, as everything that is called under its authority will be executed on page load. This is particularly good for the comments: they should be loaded as soon as the page is too. Thus, I defined a method under `methods`, 

```js
getComments() {
	axios.get('http://localhost:8000/get_comments', { params: { post: this.form.day }});
```

which is then called on `mounted()`, as well as both the interceptors.

```js
mounted() {
	axios.interceptors.response.use(res => {
	  console.log(res.data);
	  // Important: response interceptors **must** return the response.
	  return res;
	}),

	axios.interceptors.request.use(req => {
	  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
	  // Important: request interceptors **must** return the request.
	  return req;
	});

	this.getComments();
},
```

There is further work to be done with the interceptors, but, for now, this is enough to help debugging. My request was rejected, however, with the following message appearing on the browser...

```
Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://localhost:8000/get_comments?post=26. (Reason: CORS header ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ missing).
```

I'm relatively familiar with the CORS situation. It stands for *Cross-Origin Resource Sharing*, and it (loosely, to the best of my deficient understanding) stands for those situations where a request for content comes not from the host of the content -- in other words, when server A is requesting content from server B. The [always helpful Mozilla documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) provides the following example:

::: tip Example
"*An example of a cross-origin request: the front-end JavaScript code served from *`https://domain-a.com`* uses XMLHttpRequest to make a request for `https://domain-b.com/data.json`.*"
:::

This is something to be tweaked on the back-end side; we must set it to allow requests from selected origins, which will be the testing domain, `localhost:8080`, and the proper production domain `alexmakes.codes`. Luckily, there's a [very handy package](https://pypi.org/project/django-cors-headers/) that does all the heavy lifting. The instructions are very clear and I got it working first try.
