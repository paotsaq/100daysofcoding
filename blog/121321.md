## Splitting of the components 🔪

The day started with a couple of issues on the Vue components. There are still some syntax tricks that I willingly fall victim to; very simple stuff like getting stuck on `v-for "comment in comments"`, where there is a `=`: this sort of small, mindless mistakes should get caught with the IDE...but I use Vim. Of course, there are Vim plugins for this, so it really is on me not to have properly prepared my developer tools.

During the debugging process, it occured that the fetching *and* the posting of the comments are two different actions altogether; thus, they could both be refactored into two separate components. So it was done!

<FetchComments :title="$frontmatter.title"/>
<CommentsStub6 :title="$frontmatter.title"/>

## Still some CORS issue? 😳

I spent most of the morning tackling a very weird bug that was preventing proper posting of the comments to the back-end. For some reason, the back-end was being trigger for both `OPTION` and `POST` requests; and, alas, the latter's content was empty. It seems like the empty content had happened before, at some point, but I couldn't remember the exact reason. So after some fooling around - and ensuring the endpoints were working via Postman requests -, I diverged the Axios endpoints to https://httpbin.org, which is a very handy mirror to the requests.

It took a while to figure out what the issue was - at some point, I supposed the problem lied in the request headers. Turns out there was a problem with my form data.

[According to this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47630754), one needs to initialize a `FormData()` variable. When [reading the Mozilla documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData), it looks like I was very close - I had, at some point, tried this `multipart/form-data` header. But there's probably more to it than just sending the value.

## Comments section endgame 🌋

Having fixed all of this 😮‍💨 it is now time to deploy the Django back-end! This should be fun. I still have no idea how to properly pull it off, but that's a task for tomorow.
