Okay, so let me break some news to y'all: I am currently under the influence of the most coveted virus out there, and while all is fine, it really can be quite cumbersome to be isolated for more than a week. Luckily, I'm not carrying harsh symptoms, and manage to do some work every now and then. 

Today I didn't do much ‚Äî watched a Bill Forsyth film, which is always nice ‚Äî but set myself, in the last couple of hours, to finish deployment on the Raspberry. All that was missing was integration of the bzzz website under the same nginx instance, which was quite easy to pull off. It produced one of those wondrous moments in programming, where everything is working as expected from the get-go. Always nice!

There were some minor setbacks, such as getting weird errors when installing certain dependencies under the Docker container. Turns out it can be fixed by selecting a different Docker image to work with, such as `python:3-buster` instead of the regular Python image.

Alas, not *everything* is working: the Django back-end is throwing some weird 500 errors, which I didn't yet figure out, and nginx is routing `/api/` requests to both servers. It could be worse, though. Have a happy evening! üéÅ
