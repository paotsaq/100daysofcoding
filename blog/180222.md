Let my start by excusing myself from this past week's absence; it just so happens that I voluntarily undertook some very unhealthy habits that really do undermine every attempt at productivity. It is as if there's some enjoyment ‚Äî maybe escapism ‚Äî in consciously sabotaging *the daily life*. Of course *there was some programming involved*, but not at the quality nor quantity both that I usually strive for. 

In case any of you wonders, everything is definitely all good and well. Today started off with [an article](https://www.raptitude.com/2022/02/what-i-learned-during-my-three-days-offline/) on quitting the internet for three days (three days seems like *a lot*, in a way? I wonder how long has it been since I was out for three days?). I recognise in myself lots of attention-span issues, and lots of pointless web-browsing during idle times; this half-assed procrastination certainly adds up to a couple of hours, if not more, of squandered time. And while I am not (again, and miserabiliy failing at) advocating for 100% productivity 24/7, one cannot help but wonder in how such profound ways this diversion of the mind's efforts really do take a toll in the long run.

The article's comments box mention a book by **Cal Newport**, the famed author of **Deep Work** (really a great book about the perils of 21st century productivity), who went on to writing **Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World**; and I'll be tackling that next ‚Äî on my eReader, though (the irony!) üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è For now, the iPhone gave way to the sturdy, very non-futuristic Nokia, and it has already successfully averted a handful of attempts of picking it up for some mindless entertainment. Oh, but wouldn't I loe to just *fast from the internet!*
