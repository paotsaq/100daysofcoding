# Day 0 - setting up the blog && declaration of intent üéâ

### Today's achievements ‚¨áÔ∏è
- set up and deployed **this blog!**

## What is the #100DaysOfCode initiative?

There are two main rules according to the [official website](https://100daysofcode.com):
> 1. Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
> 2. Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.

I guess I will mostly stick with the first one; although I have a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/protsaq), nobody deserves to be spammed by my small increments in coding ability ü§´

## Why a website? 

swyx's [**The Coding Career Handbook**](https://www.learninpublic.org/) is very persuasive in communicating the *power of writing*. On the other hand, I am in need of a regular log to set down my goals and motivations for the hypothetical career in coding. So, instead of [building a whole website from the bottom up](https://bzzzzzzz.buzz) (which is not a great idea if you want to get productive ASAP), I searched on [JamStack](https://jamstack.org/) for an appealing stack. 

## Where am I right now - and where do I want to head next?

I am still very unsure of what I would like to pursue as a specialization - and since my (heavily air-quoted) *coding career* spans less than two years, maybe that is to be expected. However, a couple days ago I drew by hand a map of assets and interests. It was a good exercise to ground myself and my expectations - there is only so much learning you can pack in a given day - and I will post the map on this website very soon, for future reference. üí≠

- **Python** was heavily featured at the center, as it is my language of choice for a quick hack at things. Naturally I tend towards both its web frameworks (Flask and Django), but I'd also like to aprehend the basics of ML and NLP;
- **Javascript**, which is almost mandatory for any aspiring full-stack developer. This website is possible due to [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), and I thought it would be cool as an exercise to get my hands dirty with production JS;
- I am very fond of *the idea of being good at* **Lisp**. Let's blame Paul Graham for that. I would like to have at least a basic grasp of the language/paradigm, as I remember many anecdotes of code being simpler, and more powerful, in the Lisp family of languages;
- Depending on how the Lisp goes, I might want to try **Haskell**. I am very much convinced that, at some point, I need to drop everything and work on some functional programming (stuff like **Elm** is also very tempting). Again, many anecdotes make me believe functional programming is somehow less buggy, and more elegant.
- And last, but certainly not least: **metaprogramming**. A couple months ago, Professor Jurgen Vinju hosted a talk on [Rascal](https://www.rascal-mpl.org/) and it was *fascinating*. It had me wonder how much one could achieve running these algorithms on legacy code - and maybe it would be a good use for my Math background.
- There are also have some immediate obligations and projects that require my attention, specially regarding the **42 School**. In the next month, I will be tackling a raycaster using **C** for a project, and you will probably see it get featured here.

### And what about tomorrow? ‚¨áÔ∏è
- I must learn how to properly handle styling in this Vue framework; the *About* page needs a floating image.
- maybe tackle the **C** project?
