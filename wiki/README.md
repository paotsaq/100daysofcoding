## A throve of useful and/or links and information ü§ì

I'm yet not sure how to properly organise this; this is just a way for me to put together some links I found interesting, and stuff that might be useful in the future, and whatnot. 

(Rest assured I'll eventually rework the design on this page)

### Good programming üß©

[How to Write a Spelling Corrector](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html), by Peter Norvig - seems like a great, thorough article. *(added at 09/12/22)*

[An Intuition for Lisp Syntax](https://stopa.io/post/265) - a cool exercise in lisp-ifying Javascript code. *(added at 09/12/22)*

### Functional programming üç∑
(I've been interested in functional programming for a while, now.)

[Why study functional programming?](https://acm.wustl.edu/functional/whyfp.php) - some good and inspiring arguments for the case of Scheme & Haskell, and lots of great links too. (*added somewhere in late July/early August*)

### Miscellaneous stuff 

[Hydroponics: Growing an Appreciation for Plants](https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=6481) - this is a great post on hydroponic plant care ‚Äî not that I dabble with it (I'm still a very novice plant caretaker) but it has some very interesting stuff, from the salts they need to some basic Linear Algebra used in figuring out stuff. (*added at 08/10/22*)

[In Search of the Best Custom Keyboard Layout](https://josef-adamcik.cz/electronics/in-search-of-the-best-custom-keyboard-layout.html) - I'm interested in trying out some different keyboards. Not that I have wrist problems or anything ‚Äî but one looks at something like the [Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/) and can't help drool over the immense possiiblities of keyboard customisation. I suppose I'm a sucker for these things (while, on the other hand, really not quite prolific enough to deserve a 300$ keyboard). (*added at 08/20/22*)

[Configuring i3 Window Manager: a Complete Guide](https://thevaluable.dev/i3-config-mouseless/) - some cool info on i3 configs (like the one I run at `lardafada`). (*added at 08/20/22*)
