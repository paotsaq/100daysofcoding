## A throve of useful and/or links and information ü§ì

I'm yet not sure how to properly organise this; this is just a way for me to put together some links I found interesting, and stuff that might be useful in the future, and whatnot. 

(Rest assured I'll eventually rework the design on this page)

### Functional programming üç∑
(I've been interested in functional programming for a while, now.)

[Why study functional programming?](https://acm.wustl.edu/functional/whyfp.php) - some good and inspiring arguments for the case of Scheme & Haskell, and lots of great links too. (*added somewhere in late July/early August*)

[Hydroponics: Growing an Appreciation for Plants](https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=6481) - this is a great post on hydroponic plant care ‚Äî not that I dabble with it (I'm still a very novice plant caretaker ‚Äî but it has some very interesting stuff, from the salts they need to some basic Linear Algebra used in figuring out stuff. *added at 08/10/22)
